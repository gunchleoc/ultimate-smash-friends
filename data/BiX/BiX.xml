    <!-- Each movement has a at least one frame, a lenght, and can trigger
    scripted action (in python) if movments and pictures are not enought
    (creation of an object for example, action on player other than hitting)

    The movements currently supported are:
    static: character is not doing anything
    walk: basic walk
    hit: basic action to injure another character
    roll: when you go forward, when crouched
    jump: when you go up
    scnd-jump: when you are already jumping, you can do a double jump
    kick: a simple action like hit, but generaly done with foot
    kick-jumping: you can kick during a jump /!\ not sure if currently used :$
    specialhit: a more special hit, preferabily specific to character
    smash-up: a slower but more powerfull upward
    smash-down: same, downward
    smash-straight: same, left or rightâ€¦
    smash-up-jumping: like the smash upward, but activated only if the player
                        smash-up when jumping (or double jumping)
    special2: another special hit for the character.
    take: activated when the character is hit.
