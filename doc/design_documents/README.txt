In this directory design decisions about the general game, about characters and
about levels will be documented.

Code and technic should not be discussed here, it's about gameplay specifications.

Discussions about those decisions and propositions happens on the launchpad
mailing list of the project:
<usf-team@lists.launchpad.net>

you can also join us on irc
usf-game@freenode.net
